# store-api

## In this project I utilize a number of different techniques and technologies to develop a backend system with .Net.
Below you can find a detail list of the methods used in the application, but in sum the application is developed based on the repository pattern and the specification pattern together with type generics, providing the data in DTOs using AutoMapper.
Locally the project uses SQLite just for the simplefication purpose of the application, and it introduzes the identity for loging and registration.
 //TODO -> Caching will be introduced, together with Redis and a payment method ( Stripe ).
